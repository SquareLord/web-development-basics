            Paneer, a fresh cheese integral to many Indian dishes, serves as the 
            star ingredient in this recipe. Its soft texture and mild flavor make it 
            the perfect canvas for a plethora of spices. The magic truly happens when 
            the paneer is marinated in a blend of yogurt, spices, and herbs, allowing it 
            to soak up all those vibrant flavors. As the skewers hit the grill, the cheese
            develops a beautiful char, transforming each bite into a smoky, savory delight.
