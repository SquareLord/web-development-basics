            This code was made in Linux. If you want to run this code:
                - go to a Linux workspace (I used a Virtual Machine)
                - Make sure you have Visual Studio Code and Google Chrome installed
                - In the terminal, type: 
                    - "touch index.html" // creates a HTML file called index.html 
                    - "code index.html"  // opens index.html in Visual Studio Code
                - When VSC opens, copy-paste this code into the new file. 
                - In the terminal, type:
                    - "google-chrome index.html" //opens file in Google Chrome        
        -->
        <h1>Homepage</h1>
        <p>
            <a href="https://youtube.com">THIS IS A LINK</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            This link is created using the "a" tag. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The HTML attribute "href" inside the beginning "a" tag will let you place a link inside for the anchor to redirect to. (This one redirects to YouTube.)
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://youtube.com" target="_blank">This link will open in a new tab.</a>
            This link has the "target" HTML attribute set to "_blank", meaning it will open YouTube in a new window or tab.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://youtube.com" target="_self">This link will open in this tab.</a>
            This link has the "target" HTML attribute set to "_self", meaning it will open YouTube in the current tab.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://youtube.com" target="_blank">This link will open in a new tab.</a>
            This link has the "rel" HTML attribute set to "noopener", meaning the opened link will not gain access to the webpage from which it was opened.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://youtube.com" target="_blank">This link will open in a new tab.</a>
            This link has the "rel" HTML attribute set to "noreferrer", meaning the opened tab will not know the webpage it was opened from. (includes functionality of "noopener")
        </p>
        <p>
            Noopener prevents phishing attacks, where the opened link will change the original website to a scam website in case you want to go back.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, "_blank" in most browsers takes on the attributes of "noopener" and "noreferrer" anyway.
        </p>

        <!--ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE LINKS test-->

        <p>
            <a href="https://youtube.com">This is an absolute link, pointing to https://youtube.com.</a>
            It will typically be in the format, protocol://domain/path.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="relative.html">Link to relative site "relative.html"</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="relative_directory/relative_in_directory.html">Link to relative site "relative.html"</a>
        </p>
