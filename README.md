# HELLO!

I'm a high school senior based in New Jersey, and I've begun the long and arduous (it seems at least) journey through The Odin Project. I have a background in Unity for 2+ years, Android Studio for 2+ years, Java for 3+ years...

...but none of that matters. See, I've programmed in C# for Unity, but... that was for a school class. I've also programmed for Android Studio in Java... that was another class. I do know Java! But I was also taught Java for four straight years. I've never really learned the entirety of a language, or a framework, or anything just for myself.

I ask myself this every day. Do I really know how to code, if I've only taken coding classes from my high school, many of which exist only as GPA boosters? Do I really know how to code, if I've barely done any personal projects for myself? Do I really know how to code? Do I even like coding?

Well, I'm under the impression that I do know how to code, and I want to prove to myself that I have what it takes to become a full-stack engineer. 

If I don't, well, then I'll learn to become one.
