        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat.</li> 
            <li>Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li> 
            <li>Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute.</li> 
            <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper.</li> 
            <li>Simmer for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.</li> 
            <li>Remove from heat.</li> 
            <li>In a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, grated Parmesan cheese, and chopped parsley (if using).</li> 
            <li>Mix until well combined and set aside.</li> 
            <li>If using regular lasagna noodles, cook them according to package instructions until al dente.</li> 
            <li>Drain and lay them flat on a clean surface.</li> 
            <li>If using no-boil noodles, you can skip this step.</li> 
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li> 
            <li>In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of marinara sauce on the bottom.</li> 
            <li>Place a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce.</li> 
            <li>Spread half of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by a third of the shredded mozzarella.</li> 
            <li>Add another layer of marinara sauce over the mozzarella.</li> 
            <li>Repeat the layers: noodles, remaining ricotta mixture, a third of the mozzarella, and more marinara sauce.</li> 
            <li>Top with the final layer of noodles, remaining marinara sauce, and the last of the mozzarella.</li> 
            <li>Sprinkle extra Parmesan on top.</li> 
            <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil (to prevent sticking, you can spray the foil with cooking spray) and bake for 25 minutes.</li> 
            <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li> 
            <li>Allow the lasagna to cool for about 10-15 minutes before slicing.</li> 
            <li>This helps the layers set and makes serving easier.</li>
            <li>Garnish with additional parsley if desired, and enjoy your homemade lasagna!</li>
        </ol>
